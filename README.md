## AMETv1.5

Atmospheric Model Evaluation Tool (AMET) website: (https://www.epa.gov/cmaq/atmospheric-model-evaluation-tool)

The Atmospheric Model Evaluation Tool (AMET) is a suite of software designed to facilitate the analysis and evaluation of predictions from meteorological and air quality models. AMET matches the model output for particular locations to the corresponding observed values from one or more networks of monitors. These pairings of values (model and observation) are then used to statistically and graphically analyze the modelâ€™s performance.

## AMETv1.5
- New features in AMET version 1.5 include:
 -	Support added for CAPMON 
 -	New analysis scripts
  -	AQ_Kellyplot_region.R
  -	AQ_Kellyplot_season.R
  -	AQ_Kellyplot_multisim.R (removed)
  -	AQ_Plot_Spatial_MtoM_leaflet.R
  -	AQ_Scatterplot_mtom_density.R
  -	AQ_Timeseries_multi_species_plotly.R
  - AQ_Timeseries_species_plotly.R
-	New analysis script options
 -	Increased number of individual projects that can be specified (currently 18)
 -	Kelly plots have been updated better chose plot ranges
 -	Added ability to further customize Kelly plots through input options
 -	Added function to only use common sites between multiple projects (useful for comparing two different sized domains)
-	Updated batch scripts to incorporate new analysis scripts
-	Updated AQ_species_list.input file:
 -	to properly map species in the updated AMET observation files (specifically related to EC/OC)
 -	to include additional species
 -	to include CAPMON
-	Added option to rename an existing project
-	Updated AMET-AQ observation files (see notes below)
-	Numerous minor bug fixes
-	Some improvements made to error checking and reporting

* Improved error handling for missing data
* Simplified process for adding new AQ networks/species
* New interactive HTML R plots using the leaflet and dyGraphs R packages
* Added support for global TOAR and NOAA ESRL networks
* Ability to process and analyze AQ data without the database present
* Improved batch scripting for AQ analysis
* New WRF/MPAS upper-air rawinsonde analysis
* New WRF/MPAS surface shortwave radiation analysis
* New WRF/MPAS PRISM rainfall analysis
* New 2-m moisture time series comparison with RH
* Fixed MADIS download when file is not on FTP server
* Site metadata improved to include state and elevation
* Improve speed of database population
