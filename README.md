Atmospheric Model Evaluation Tool (AMET) website: (https://www.epa.gov/cmaq/atmospheric-model-evaluation-tool)

The Atmospheric Model Evaluation Tool (AMET) is a suite of software designed to facilitate the analysis and evaluation of predictions from meteorological and air quality models. AMET matches the model output for particular locations to the corresponding observed values from one or more networks of monitors. These pairings of values (model and observation) are then used to statistically and graphically analyze the modelâ€™s performance.

New features in AMET version 1.4 include:
* Streamlined database query function for AMET-AQ
* Improved error handling for missing data
* Simplified process for adding new AQ networks/species
* New interactive HTML R plots using the leaflet and dyGraphs R packages
* Added support for global TOAR and NOAA ESRL networks
* Ability to process and analyze AQ data without the database present
* Improved batch scripting for AQ analysis
* New WRF/MPAS upper-air rawinsonde analysis
* New WRF/MPAS surface shortwave radiation analysis
* New WRF/MPAS PRISM rainfall analysis
* New 2-m moisture time series comparison with RH
