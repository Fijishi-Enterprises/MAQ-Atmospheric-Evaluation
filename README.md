Atmospheric Model Evaluation Tool (AMET) version 1.4 Beta
=======


## AMET Overview

The Atmospheric Model Evaluation Tool (AMET) is a suite of software designed to facilitate the analysis and evaluation of predictions from meteorological and air quality models. AMET matches the model output for particular locations to the corresponding observed values from one or more networks of monitors. These pairings of values (model and observation) are then used to statistically and graphically analyze the modelâ€™s performance.

## Getting the AMET Repository
This AMET Git archive is organized with each official public release stored as a branch on the main USEPA/AMET repository.
To clone code from the AMET Git archive, specify the branch (i.e. version number) and issue the following command from within
a working directory on your server:
```
git clone -b 1.4b https://github.com/USEPA/AMET.git AMET_v14b
```


## AMET 1.4 Repository Guide
Source code and scripts are organized as follows:
* **configure:** AMET configuration scripts
* **docs:** AMET documentation
* **obs:** air quality and meteorology observational data
* **output:** output from AMET analysis scripts
* **R_db_code:** R code for loading data to the AMET MySQL database
* **R_analysis_code:** R codes for generating AMET analysis plots
* **scripts_analysis:** scripts for running AMET analyses
* **scripts_db:** scripts for loading the AMET database
* **src:** source code of the AMET model->obs utility programs

## Documentation
