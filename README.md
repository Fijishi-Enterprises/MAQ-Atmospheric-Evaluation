## AMETv1.5

Atmospheric Model Evaluation Tool (AMET) website: (https://www.epa.gov/cmaq/atmospheric-model-evaluation-tool)

The Atmospheric Model Evaluation Tool (AMET) is a suite of software designed to facilitate the analysis and evaluation of predictions from meteorological and air quality models. AMET matches the model output for particular locations to the corresponding observed values from one or more networks of monitors. These pairings of values (model and observation) are then used to statistically and graphically analyze the modelâ€™s performance.

[Frequently asked questions for upgrading to the latest AMET version](https://github.com/USEPA/AMET/blob/develop/docs/AMET_FAQ.md) - Updated for v1.5 release.

## AMETv1.5

-	Support added for CAPMON 
-	New analysis scripts (https://github.com/USEPA/AMET/blob/develop/docs/AMET_User_Guide_v15.md#73-summary-of-the-aq-analysis-scripts)
       - New version of Kellyplot to plot multiple simulations by NOAA climate region (AQ_Kellyplot_region.R)
       - New version of Kellyplot to plot multiple simulations by season (AQ_Kellyplot_season.R)
       - Removed one of the existing version of the Kellyplot as it was reduntant with the new Kellyplots that were added (AQ_Kellyplot_multisim.R) 
       - New leaflet (interactive) version of the model-to-model AQ spatial plot (AQ_Plot_Spatial_MtoM_leaflet.R)
       - New model-to-model desity scatter plot (AQ_Scatterplot_mtom_density.R)
       - New species plotly (interactive) time series plot (AQ_Timeseries_species_plotly.R)
       - New multi-species plotly (interactive) time series plot (AQ_Timeseries_multi_species_plotly.R)
-	New analysis script options (https://github.com/USEPA/AMET/blob/develop/docs/AMET_User_Guide_v15.md#aq-analysis-input-files)
       - Increased number of individual projects that can be specified from 10 to 20
       - Kelly plots have been updated better choose default plot ranges
       - Added ability to further customize Kelly plots through input options (min, max, interval)
       - Added function to only use common sites between multiple projects (useful for comparing data from two different sized domains)
-	Updated batch scripts to incorporate new analysis scripts
-	Updated AQ_species_list.input file to:
       - properly map species in the updated AMET observation files (specifically related to EC/OC)
       - include additional species
       - include CAPMON
-	Added option to rename an existing project while retaining existing data
-	Updated AMET-AQ observation files (see notes in [AMET_Release_Observation_Files_Readme.txt](https://github.com/USEPA/AMET/files/8655699/AMET_Release_Observation_Files_Readme.txt))
-	Numerous minor bug fixes
-	Some improvements made to error checking and reporting
